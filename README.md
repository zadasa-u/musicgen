# musicgen
This code generates simple music using concatenated sinusoidal tones. Each tone has a frequency given by the dictionary of notes. Then, to make a musical theme, it is enough to generate a list that contains information about the note, its duration and also if there is a time of silence between notes... to simulate the instrument.
